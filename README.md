# DismalSniper
A name sniper for Minecraft (Leaked)


# Preface
<p>
Let this be a lesson to you Liza, if you're going to insult me and the rest of the community, don't send me the source to your sniper first.

Dismal sniper is a name sniper developed by Liza, it is also completely awful, it's timing is completely wrong and for some reason the development team decided it would be a fabulous idea to add HTTP headers that don't actually exist, why? who really knows, I for sure don't, no where I've looked says to use imaginary headers, but hey, each to their own I suppose.
